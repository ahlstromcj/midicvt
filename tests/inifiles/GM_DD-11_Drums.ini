# Generated by modifying an existing drum file manually for the Yamaha DD-11.
#
# This file provides easy-to-use settings for remapping some MIDI events
# so that a MIDI file for a specific device plays back in General MIDI (GM).
# This file consists of one unnamed section and a number of named sections
# as described below.  Note that the 'name' values can be empty, if you don't
# want to key them in.
#
# The unnamed section:
#
#  file-style       The format of the INI file.  Values: 'sectioned' (only).
#  setup-name       Provides a name for the setup, for information only.
#  map-type         Types of maps in this file: 'drum', 'patch', or 'multi'.
#  gm-channel       Indicates the drum channel for GM.   Usually 10.
#  dev-channel      Drum channel for the device.  Some use channel 16.
#  extract-channel  Channel to write to MIDI file.  Other channels dropped.
#  reject-channel   Channel for events to be dropped from the new MIDI file.
#  reverse          Reverse mapping. Usually better as a command-line option.
#  testing          Do the latest developer test.  Command-line preferred.
#
# The drum section:
#
#  [Drum 35].  Marks a drum-change section, one per instrument.
#
#  gm-name          Provides the GM name for the drum assigned to this note.
#  gm-note          Provides the GM note number, same as the section number.
#  dev-name         Provides device name for the drum assigned to this note.
#  dev-note         MIDI note to convert gm-note to for GM-compliant playback.
#  gm-equiv         Provides a name for the intended replacement.  In some
#                   cases, there is no GM drum equivalent, so we use something
#                   close enough.
