#
# This file provides easy-to-use settings for remapping some MIDI events
# so that a MIDI file for a specific device plays back in General MIDI (GM).
# This file consists of one unnamed section and a number of named sections
# as described below.  Note that the 'name' values can be empty, if you don't
# want to key them in.
#
# The unnamed section:
#
#  file-style.      The format of the INI file.  Values: 'sectioned' (only).
#  setup-name.      Provides a name for the setup, for information only.
#  map-type.        Types of maps in this file: 'drum', 'patch', or 'multi'.
#  gm-channel.      Indicates the drum channel for GM.   Usually 10.
#  dev-channel.     Drum channel for the device.  Some use channel 16.
#  extract-channel. Channel to write to MIDI file.  Other channels dropped.
#  reject-channel.  Channel for events to be dropped from the new MIDI file.
#  reverse.         Reverse mapping. Usually better as a command-line option.
#  testing.         Do the latest developer test.  Command-line preferred.
#
# The drum section:
#
#  [Drum 35].  Marks a drum-change section, one per instrument.
#
#  gm-name.         Provides the GM name for the drum assigned to this note.
#  gm-note.         Provides the GM note number, same as the section number.
#  dev-name.        Provides device name for the drum assigned to this note.
#  dev-note.        MIDI note to convert gm-note to for GM-compliant playback.
#  gm-equiv.        Provides a name for the intended replacement.  In some
#                   cases, there is no GM drum equivalent, so we use something
#                   close enough.
#
# The patch/program section:
#
#  [Patch 35].      Marks a patch-change section, one per program.
#
#  gm-name.         The name of the patch/program in the GM layout.
#  gm-patch.        MIDI patch number corresponding to the named instrument.
#  dev-name.        Name of the device patch corresponding to this MIDI note.
#  dev-patch.       MIDI patch number to which this patch number is converted.
